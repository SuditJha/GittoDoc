      <p className="text-xl py-4"> Introduction to Git Worktrees</p>
      <p className="py-4">
        Git worktrees allow you to work on multiple branches simultaneously
        within the same repository. It's like having multiple workstations for
        different tasks, each with its own context and changes, all linked to
        the same repository.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl py-4"> Why Use Git Worktrees?</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
        <li className="py-2">
          <b>Concurrent Development:</b> Work on different branches in parallel
          without switching back and forth.
        </li>
        <li className="py-2">
          <b>Isolated Context:</b> Maintain separate working directories for
          each branch, avoiding conflicts.
        </li>
        <li className="py-2">
          <b>Multi-Tasking:</b> Handle bug fixes, feature development, and
          experiments simultaneously.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-xl py-4"> Practical Example: Using Git Worktrees ðŸŒŸ</p>
      <p className="py-4">
        Suppose youâ€™re working on a new feature branch while your colleague
        fixes a critical bug in the `main` branch. Hereâ€™s how you can create and
        manage a worktree for concurrent development:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside ml-6">
        <li className="py-2">
          <b>Create a Worktree:</b>
        </li>
        <pre className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-2 rounded">
          <code>
            git worktree add ../my-feature-feature-branch feature-branch
          </code>
        </pre>

        <li className="py-2">
          <b>Switch to the Worktree:</b>
        </li>
        <p className="py-2">
          Navigate to the new worktree and start working on your feature.
        </p>

        <li className="py-2">
          <b>Manage Worktrees:</b>
        </li>
        <p className="py-2">
          List and remove worktrees as needed using Git commands.
        </p>
      </ol>

      <p className="text-xl py-4"> Important Notes</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
        <li className="py-2">
          <b>Linked to Branches:</b> Each worktree is linked to a specific
          branch within the same repository.
        </li>
        <li className="py-2">
          <b>Context Switching:</b> Maintain focus and context across multiple
          tasks without losing progress.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="py-4">
        By mastering Git worktrees, you can effectively manage concurrent tasks
        and workflows within the same repository, enhancing productivity and
        collaboration across teams.
